## About XCF project: 

is a global conversion to OpenXcom (clone of the classic UFO:Enemy Unknown 1994, https://github.com/OpenXcom/OpenXcom & https://github.com/MeridianOXC/OpenXcom), preserving the original setting. It will allow you to grow X-Com from its humbled beginnings, as a two-men team travelling the world in an expensive-looking car to global the military force we all know and love. It contains many, many additions, like new mission types, enemies, equipment and story arcs (including the entirety of my previous project, the Final Mod Pack). It also places the game a bit more firmly in the 90's conspiracy genre and its clich√©s.
Defeat the enemies from the outer space, the oceans the underground, but primarily within our own society!
