# xpedia

Autogenerated searcheable HTML reference for OpenXCom games.

## Building: 

```
yarn install
npm run build
```

## Using:

Copy contents of xpedia.zip to the root directory of the game.

Run xpedia.bat to construct and open xpedia.html.

Or if you already has up-to-date xpedia.html you can just open it directly.

If mod is *not* XPiratez, edit xpedia.bat to change mod's name.

## Debugging

```
npm run dev
```

You will need to generate xpedia.html as above and copy it to /public/xpedia.html
Also, to have pictures, copy /user directory from the game to /public/user
